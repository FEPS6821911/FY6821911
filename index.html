 This project discusses the importance of acoustics in civil engineering, especially in room design. Acoustics is the science of sound and how it interacts with the environment. It can affect the mood, wellbeing, and productivity of the occupants. This project explains how sound waves are generated, propagated, and reflected in different settings, and how they can cause issues such as noise, reverberation, and echo.
  The project also suggests some acoustic solutions and principles that can be applied to design rooms that are more comfortable, functional, and enjoyable for the users and how highlight the importance of engineers in creating environments that allow people to work at their best.

  Not much thought is usually given to the design of rooms we use but the truth is that, our designs must account for how sound waves behave to ensure our spaces aren't either too noisy or quiet.
  thus understanding sound waves is important for engineers, as it allows them to design spaces that we can enjoy.
  Sound waves are rhythmic disturbances in air molecules, propagated through compressions and rarefactions.
  When a source vibrates, it compresses and expands air particles, creating a pressure wave. These waves, perceived by our ears, constitute what we recognise as sound.
  In this project, I attempt to discuss the importance of acoustics in civil engineering, especially in room design. Acoustics is the science of sound and how it interacts with the environment.
  It can affect the mood, wellbeing, and productivity of the occupants. For example, in a classroom, office, or home, it is desirable to create a quiet and peaceful environment that allows for concentration, learning, and relaxation. 
  Excessive noise, reverberation, or echo can cause stress, fatigue, annoyance, or distraction.

 <h3 id="Analysis and discussion"> Analysis and discussion</h3>
To understand acoustics, we need to understand how sound waves behave in different settings. In his book “Acoustics: An Introduction”, Heinrich Kuttruff explains that a sound wave is a rhythmic disturbance that stems from a vibrating source. As this source moves, it compresses and expands air molecules, generating a chain reaction of compressions and rarefactions.  These fluctuations set off a domino effect in the air particles, forming a distinctive pattern of alternating high and low-pressure zones.

Waves carry sound energy through the medium, usually in all directions and less intensely as they move farther from the source. In fact, in a perfect environment where there is no reverberation or echo, sound waves follow the inverse square law, which states that the intensity of sound is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source.
However, when these waves hit a reflective surface such as walls, ceilings, or floors, they rebound and create a collection of reflected sounds – this is known as reverberation.
Reverberation time is the time it takes for these sounds to disappear(Reverberation time (muffle)). This time period is easily affected and can be increased or decreased by several internal factors, such as the size, shape, and material of the room. Reverberation is not necessarily a bad thing, as it depends entirely on the context and purpose of the room. 
Some environments will benefit from prolonged reverberation time, whereas other environments will need a shorter reverb time. 
 The acceptable reverberation time varies depending on the room’s expected use. For instance, most courtrooms require a reverberation time of 1.0 seconds or less, while larger lecture halls require 1.0 seconds.
Restaurants require 0.7-1.1 seconds(Reverberation time,Equez,2017), from formal to sports bars.One way to measure the reverberation time of a room is to use the noise reduction coefficient (NRC), which tells us how much sound an acoustic product can absorb. This is an effective way to plan for a quieter space. NRC is measured on a scale that ranges from 0 to 1. An NRC of 0 means that the product absorbs no sound whereas a NRC rating of 1 means that the product absorbs all sound.
The higher the NRC, the better the product is at soaking up the sound. Thicker samples of the same material often absorb more sound and are better at absorbing lower frequencies.

          <td>0.07</td>

     In figure 1, we can see just how much more effective carpets are at reducing noise compared to exposed wood and it's exactly why it’s a commonly used method (think of how much of the university is covered by carpets).
  Carpets can reduce airborne noise by 35%. The installation of carpet and underlay is the only method available for eliminating excessive noise generated by floor impacts such as noise produced from footfalls, chairs scraped across the floor and objects dropped on the floor.
  Another acoustic issue that can arise in room design is echo. Echoes are similar to reverberation in that they are caused by reflected sound waves bouncing back into the room.
  They can be annoying or distracting, especially in rooms that are large, empty, or have hard surfaces. Since echo is caused by those large flat surfaces that reflect sound waves so well, one can significantly reduce echo with treatments like diffusers and acoustical panels. Diffusers are devices that scatter sound waves in different directions, creating a more uniform sound field. 
  Acoustical panels are materials that absorb sound waves and reduce their intensity.By applying these acoustic principles and solutions, we can design rooms that are more comfortable, functional, and enjoyable for the users.
